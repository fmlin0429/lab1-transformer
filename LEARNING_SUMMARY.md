# CPU Training Learning Summary

## What We Accomplished Today

✅ **Successfully configured CPU-only training** for your transformer model
✅ **Identified the GPU compatibility issue** with RTX 5060 (sm_120 architecture)
✅ **Created multiple working examples** of CPU training
✅ **Learned 4 different methods** to force CPU usage

## The Problem We Solved

Your RTX 5060 Laptop GPU uses CUDA architecture `sm_120`, but PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121 only supports up to `sm_90`. This caused CUDA kernel errors.

## 4 Methods to Force CPU Usage

### 1. Environment Variable (Most Reliable)
```bash
# Windows
set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=

# Linux/Mac
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=''
```

### 2. Global Override in Code
```python
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available = lambda: False
```

### 3. Explicit Device Specification
```python
device = torch.device('cpu')
model = model.to(device)
```

### 4. Config-Based Approach
```python
config['device'] = 'cpu'
device = torch.device(config['device'])
```

## Files Created for Learning

1. **`cpu_demo.py`** - Basic CPU usage demonstration
2. **`train_simple.py`** - Working transformer model on CPU
3. **`cpu_training_guide.py`** - Comprehensive guide with all methods
4. **`train_cpu.py`** - Full training script with CPU enforcement

## Key Learning Points

### CPU Training Benefits
- ✅ Works on any computer
- ✅ No GPU memory issues
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ No CUDA compatibility problems

### When to Use CPU vs GPU
- **CPU**: Learning, debugging, testing, small datasets
- **GPU**: Production training, large datasets, speed-critical applications

## Next Steps for GPU Training (When Ready)

When you want to use your RTX 5060 GPU:

1. **Install PyTorch Nightly**:
   ```bash
   pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu124
   ```

2. **Or use CPU for now** to understand the model architecture

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run CPU training demo
python cpu_training_guide.py

# Run simple transformer on CPU
python train_simple.py

# Check current setup
python cpu_demo.py
```

## Your Current Setup Status

- ✅ Python environment: Active
- ✅ PyTorch: Working on CPU
- ✅ Model: 45.6M parameters (fits in RAM)
- ✅ Dataset: Ready for CPU processing
- ✅ Training: Ready to start

You now have a fully functional transformer training setup that works on CPU, perfect for learning and debugging before moving to GPU acceleration!
